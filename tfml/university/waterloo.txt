domestic students by 4. Since Waterloo's programs are co-op, those costs may go up or down based on
n
how work goes. Do remember the cost of living fees and other expenses like mandatory meal plans are not
n
included. This cost ranges from $-100,000 to $100,000 depending on how you manage your finances and how

Credentials
n
For reading all of that: you get nothing. However, if you also take all of those courses
n
and graduate from Waterloo, you get a shiny Bachelor's of Computer Science Degree!
n
If that seems daunting, perhaps try some other schools! Or look at the market outlook!
